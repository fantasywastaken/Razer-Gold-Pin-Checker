# üêç Razer Gold PIN Checker (Undetected TLS)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JEHQuPN.png">

This Python tool allows you to log into your Razer Gold account and validate Razer Gold PIN codes ‚Äî without using a browser. It operates via a TLS fingerprinted session that mimics Chrome behavior and includes CAPTCHA solving using CapSolver.

The tool is fully automated and designed to work with proxyless requests.

Currently, this version is tailored for **Turkish Lira (‚Ç∫)**. However, it can be easily modified to support other currencies.

### üì¶ Installation

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Install dependencies:

```
pip install tls-client loguru capsolver
```

---

### üìÅ File Structure

- config.json: Login credentials and CapSolver key
- codes.txt: List of Razer Gold PIN codes (one per line)
- wrong.txt: Automatically generated file that stores failed codes

Example config.json:
```
{
    "EMAIL": "your_email@example.com",
    "PASSWORD": "U2FsdGVkX19...==",
    "CAPSOLVER_KEY": "your-capsolver-api-key"
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The PASSWORD must be in encrypted form. You can retrieve this by opening Razer Gold‚Äôs login page in a browser and monitoring network traffic after logging in. Look for the field encryptedPw in the POST request.

### üîê Important Notes on Login

The login XML payload:
```
<COP><User><email>{EMAIL}</email><password>{PASSWORD}</password></User><ServiceCode>0060</ServiceCode></COP>
```

The ServiceCode may change based on screen resolution. It defaults to 0060 for 1920x1080 resolution. You must verify this if you use a different screen setup.
